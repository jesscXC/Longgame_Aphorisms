"In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts." -- Ralph Waldo Emerson

Learning: it's a lifestyle.

To remember is to rewrite history.

Once you've started you're almost done.

Everyone believes the evidence is on their side.

Your future self thanks you for every second spent improving yourself.

What are you trying to do?

Chase away pain by partitioning your mind and body.

Your life starts now, not tomorrow, and not in the past. Live it the way you want.

The most verifiable truth is that nothing is truly verifiable.

The only one you truly need to impress is yourself.

The journey, not the destination, is what is worthwhile.

Live life like you would want your best friend to.

Do a little every single day, and soon you'll have a lot.

What is important in development is not merely the tools, but also the environment the tools are used in.

It's hard at first but just keep doing it and it gets a lot easier.

Starting is harder than continuing.

If you don't give up you haven't failed.

Sometimes you'll spend more time rationalizing why you don't need to do something than it would take to do it.

...

Humans are animals. But some animals are humans.

Things are changing all the time.

There is always someone who would trade everything they have to be where you are.

It's like remembering reading a book, but also remembering experiencing the book.

Perfection is the enemy of progress.

If it doesn't work, try something else.

When you are in a cycle, it taints your views of the other cycles. And you are always in some cycle.

Maybe you don't have the knowledge, but do you know where to find it?

Without work, leisure becomes work.

The clothing you wear affects your own view of yourself.

Before initiating any project, list why you want it to succeed, why you will put in the hard work day after day when the going gets tough.

Obviously a god can exist outside our perceivable universe just as we can exist outside a simulation we run.

Put less food on your plate and eat more deliberately. It will be better.

Your preconceptions of the world can hide opportunity from you.

Act to live interesting stories.

Words are the most powerful things on Earth: they hold the power to inspire and embolden, to weaken and shatter.

Fashion may not be immediately functional, but it gives impressions to others; that is the function.

Mix the old ways and the new ways to find more.

There is so much beauty, if you would only look.

You are the challenges you've faced.

Be flexible yet remember the original plan.

Break the ice by stirring the air with words. Silence is freezing.

Any action counts more than nonexistent perfect action.

The number of pages in a book does not necessarily correlate to the impact it can have on you.

...

When the perfect doesn't happen, the good is best.

A messy space attracts disorder.

The potential for creative entities is unbounded.

There are always other ways that work.

If other people can do it, you can learn to do it.

Sometimes you have to really mess things up to straighten them out.

There are so many good things.

Anything you write is a poem.

Don't condemn what other people like.

Have few things and get good stuff.

You don't make better decisions while tired.

...

Everyone is insecure.

You'd be surprised how much you can learn and remember.

More knowledge means more patterns you can perceive.

Double-checking is almost always worthwhile.

Sometimes keeping quiet when you make a mistake is best.

Sometimes rest is the right answer.

It's hard to fall asleep while anticipating something.

Don't run from who you are. Enjoy every step. Enjoy being yourself.

Let go of your fear. It's not that serious.

You learn when you teach.

...

Healing cannot be forced.

When worried, carve out and identify the issue. Write things you can do about it, and things you can't.

Support local companies? No, support good companies.

Learn something new.

It's funny when people talk like they know what they're talking about.

How good you are is how things go when they aren't perfect.

We love people for what they bring out in us.

Catch the wind and you'll go further.

Mystery is the entity in control of our simulation.

World peace is composed of many individual pieces.

When there are constant problems within your core the constant reflection blocks your view of the outside world.

It's not where you live but how you live.

There is a subtle pleasure in experiencing the bad.

Cushion the blows with a pillow of serenity.

...

You can tell a lot about a person if you look.

Most people are alone.

The less freedom you have, the scarier it is.

If no one will know who you are, experiment and be someone different.

Life gets more complex.

The small collect and the big grow off from it.

It's easier to break something than fix it.

There are always great things to experience.

Rules are meant to be sensible and self-aware.
